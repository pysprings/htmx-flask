# HTMX Flask Integration Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a reference implementation that demonstrates the integration of
HTMX with Flask. The project aims to establish best practices and patterns for building modern web applications using
HTMX and Flask technologies while maintaining simplicity and developer ergonomics.

## Objective
To create a minimal but complete TODO application that demonstrates HTMX features within a Flask environment, addressing
common implementation challenges and establishing consistent patterns for partial page updates, server responses, and
client-side interactions.

## Features

### Core Functionality
1. Implementation of partial response handling through proper header support
2. Flash message system integration with Out-of-Band (OOB) updates
3. Consistent template organization and naming conventions
   - Clear distinction between fragment templates and full-page templates
   - Standardized naming pattern (e.g., `widget.j2.html` for full pages, `_widget.j2.html` for fragments)

### Developer Experience Requirements
1. Elegant handling of both fragment and full-page load scenarios
2. Streamlined integration with Flask infrastructure for request processing
3. Organized and testable template structure
4. Maintainable client-side script configuration with testing capabilities
5. Implementation of loading state indicators
6. Defined pattern for event handling and JavaScript integration

## Environment

### Technical Environment
- Server: Flask web framework
- Client-side Enhancement: HTMX library
- Template System: Jinja2

### Development Environment Requirements
1. Support for template testing
2. Infrastructure for client-side script testing
3. Capability to handle both partial and full-page requests
4. Support for flash message management

## Constraints
1. Implementation must remain minimal while demonstrating all core HTMX features
2. Solution must maintain consistency with Flask's architectural patterns
3. All features must be implemented with consideration for testability

## Success Criteria
1. Successful demonstration of all core HTMX features
2. Clear and consistent patterns for template organization
3. Effective handling of flash messages
4. Maintainable and testable codebase
5. Smooth integration between server-side and client-side functionality
